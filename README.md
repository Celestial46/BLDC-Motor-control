# BLDC-Motor-control
Sensored brushless motor control using PIC16F877
Basically there are two types of brushless motors: sensored and sensorless. Sensored BLDC motors come with three hall effect sensors which are used to detect (know) the position of the rotor (where it is located) at any moment, thatâ€™s why they called sensored.
The second type is: sensorless BLDC motors. Sensorless BLDC motor has no sensor to detect the rotor position, it has only 3 wires for power (3-phase). The commutation of sensorless BLDC motor is based on the BEMF (Back Electromotive Force) produced in the stator windings.
